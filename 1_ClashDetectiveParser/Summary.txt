Background:
  In Navisworks Freedom, there is no "Clash Detection" feature.
  This document is the solution to offer the information of "Clash Detection" result for Navisworks Freedom users
  (Such as construction site staff managers and so on..)
  
Idea
  1. Clash Detective report can be exported to an HTML file, including the data of "Element ID"
  2. Navisworks Manage's 'datatool' feature can be used for making a group set by properties like element id and so on.
  â†’ This means that : By HTML parsing, we can make a set to select objects which is on Clash Detection report.
